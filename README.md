# nonlinear-kink-oscillations
This project include analytic formula of nonlinear kink oscillations damped by KHI-induced turbulence (written in IDL/Python) and procedures to fit the data by this function.
The fitting ptocedure is demonstarted by mcmc_models_fitting.pro, which use SoBAT Toolkit (https://github.com/Sergey-Anfinogentov/SoBAT).
